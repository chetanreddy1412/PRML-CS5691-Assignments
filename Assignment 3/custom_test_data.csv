I had a couple of doubts about assignment 3 in PRML (CS5691). It would be helpful if you could clarify:
1. The emails given in the test folder are not plain text and not readable (I have attached the screenshot), could you clarify how our code is supposed to read it?
2. For feature extraction (not model), can we use library functions like bag of words or tfidf from sklearn?
Thank you.

I had a few doubts about assignment 2 in PRML (CS5691). It will be helpful if you could clarify:
1. In question 1, subparts (i) and (ii), we are asked to average over 100 random initialisations, does this mean that Theta (the parameters set) is randomly initialised. In class, it was suggested to perform Llyods Algorithm to initialise theta (instead of random initialisation), are we not expected to do this?
2. In Question 1, subpart (iv), we are asked to compare the three algorithms (mixture of distribution of our choice, mixture of gaussian and Kmeans), but Kmeans is completely a different algorithm with a different purpose compared to a mixture of gaussians, on what aspect should we choose the best algorithm.
I have attached the assignment pdf for your quick reference.
Thank you.

Warm regards,"
0,"Dear student,

 

Thank you for your email.

 

2/3 means two thirds of courses. For one term, 20 credits out of 30 would be from one field of study, and the rest can be chosen freely from available courses.
I couldn’t open the document
You can indicate the 2-5 credits in the study plan, so that the total number of credits is min. 25-30 (or even a bit over 30 credits, as there will probably be changes to courses when registering for them)
Unfortunately the course CS-E4875 Research Project in Machine Learning, Data Science and Artificial Intelligence D is not available to exchange students

Hope you are doing fine.

We are extremely sorry for the lack of communication about the progress. After the last call, we tried executing Joel's code as you had suggested. We simply couldn't reproduce his results despite trying our best.

Secondly, we realised that the problem statement doesn't align with our area of expertise and it was requiring too much effort to understand the algorithms as we felt that we don't have the prerequisites. We wanted to convey this much earlier but were still hoping to push ourselves and get some work done. That somehow never happened.

Due to all this and with a heavy academic load this semester, we regret to inform you that we have made the decision of discontinuing this project. We are sorry and thank you for the guidance given for the duration we worked.

11 COVID-19 cases emerged during 19-21 April 2022 in the hostel zone. Based on which, the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) decided to carry out the saturation testing for Bhadra, Sarayu and Mandakini Hostel residents. Out of 1394 hostel residents tested, additional 41 hostel residents were diagnosed with Covid-19. The students tested positive for Covid-19 were moved to the Taramani Guest House (TGH). The Institute Doctors and the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) officials are monitoring and administering the treatment at the TGH. The Tamil Nadu Health Secretary also visited the hostel zone and TGH Quarantine facility on a regular basis.

 

In order to contain the further spread of infections in the hostel zone, the GCC advised us to implement the self-isolation protocols for the Mandakini and Sarayu Hostel residents. Accordingly, the OHM has made the necessary arrangements for the supply of food in the hostel premises since 22 April 2022 (Friday) lunch session.

Today, the GCC carried out the saturation testing of mess staff and CMGFS vendors and students (591 tests). On 24 April 2022 (Sunday), they will be carrying out the random testing of other hostel residents.

As the number of cases are increasing in the hostel zone, we humbly request all the Hostel residents to strictly adhere to the following COVID-19 basic preventive measures.

1. To maintain the social distance at all times.

2. To use face masks at all times.

3. To follow the respiratory etiquettes strictly.

4. To maintain hand hygiene.

5. To self-monitor the health and report any illness to the Institute Hospital immediately.  

6. Please do not go to your laboratories and dine in the messes if you are sick (cold, fever, headache, sore throat, cough, etc.) and seek immediate medical advice. If the Institute Medical Officers advise you to be in the room isolation, please inform ccw.mess@smail.iitm.ac.in, giving details of your mobile no., room no., hostel name and Caterer name so that the arrangement for delivery of food packets at your room can be made.

Further, we request you to strictly dine in the allotted slot for the safety of all. 

Thank you very much for your cooperation and support.

I am   N, presently a third-year undergraduate student pursuing a B-Tech in engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras (IIT-M).  I am writing this email to apply for a winter internship (Dec 2021 - Jan 2022) at the AI and Robotics Technology Park (ARTPARK).

 

Robotics and artificial intelligence has always fascinated me with their limitless capacity to transform the world into a better place. Skilled in Python, I have striven to establish a good foundation in machine learning, computer vision, reinforcement learning and robotics through various courses and hands-on experience. The elegance behind the seemingly intimidating mathematics and the surprising potential of AI and Robotics to solve innumerable problems in the world is what drives me to take up a career in this domain. I am extremely passionate about gaining practical exposure and deepening my understanding of the subject.

 

I came across ARTPARK’s work for the first time through the youtube video about Asha, the humanoid robot which was incredibly fascinating to watch and have been acquainted with since then. ARTPARK’s charter to create an inclusive AI and robotics future strongly resonates with me. It would be a matter of great honour to work on any of the ongoing research projects being undertaken in ARTPARK. I understand that there may not be open positions at the moment but I strongly believe that I can be an asset if given the opportunity. I assure you that I will, by all means, put in my best efforts and stay committed to the allotted project and do any kind of work that is given as a part of the internship.

 

Please find attached my CV for your kind perusal. Hoping to hear from you soon.

Thank you.

I hope this mail finds you in good health. 

I am   N , presently a 3rd-year engineering student at IIT-Madras. I was a student of your course- The Strength of Materials (AM2200) during my 3rd semester (July-November 2020) and had received an S grade in the same. This mail is regarding a Letter of Recommendation (LoR) for MITACS which is a prestigious global research internship programme by Canadian universities. Selected students will be able to participate in a 12-week research internship in Canada under the supervision of the allotted Canadian university faculty members.

Given that everything has been online since the pandemic started, it was difficult for me to pursue projects under the professors of our institute during my 2nd year. Course classes, although virtual, have been the only way to connect with professors. Strength of Materials was the most interesting course in my 3rd semester and the strong foundation from the course helped me excel in other courses which build upon it.  My main research interests include robotics and the use of machine learning in mechanics like physics-informed neural networks and I am looking forward to doing a foreign research internship in these fields in summer 2022.

For the MITACS program, the applicant is required to provide details of one of the professors of his/her institute. The professor would be contacted later by MITACS to provide the LoR.

I would be extremely grateful if you could give your consent to providing a letter of recommendation for me. I have attached my CV for your reference. The last date for applying is 21st September. Hence, it would be helpful if you could communicate your decision regarding the same at your earliest convenience, so as to enable me to apply for the programme.
